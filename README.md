## Description
iReporter is a platform aimed at combating corruption in Africa by enabling citizens to report incidents of corruption and issues requiring government intervention. The platform empowers users to create red-flag reports linked to corruption and intervention records for government actions, bringing these issues to the attention of appropriate authorities and the general public.

## MVP Features
1. Users can create an account and log in.
2. Users can create a red-flag record (an incident linked to corruption).
3. Users can create intervention records (a call for government intervention on issues like bad roads, collapsed bridges, or flooding).
4. Users can edit their red-flag or intervention records.
5. Users can delete their red-flag or intervention records.
6. Users can add geolocation (latitude and longitude coordinates) to their red-flag or intervention records.
7. Users can update the geolocation of their records.
8. Admin can change the status of a record to "under investigation," "rejected" (for false claims), or "resolved."
9. Users can attach images to their records to support their claims.
10. Users can add videos to their records.
12. Users receive real-time email notifications when an admin updates the status of their record.
13. The application can display a Google Map with markers indicating the location of red-flag or intervention reports.

## Notes:
- Users can only change the geolocation of a red-flag/intervention record if the status is not "under investigation," "rejected," or "resolved."
- Users can only edit or delete a record if the status is not "under investigation," "rejected," or "resolved."
- Only the user who created the record can delete it.
